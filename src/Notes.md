Components are two type
 1.class based (class Components) 
 2.function based (fucntional Components)


State:  
State is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.


Props:

 Props are properties passed down from a parent component to its child components. They act as a way for parent components to provide data or configuration to their children
 in other words 
 Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are passed in a unidirectional flow from parent to child

 useState:
the useState hook is a built-in function that allows you to manage state within the component. State represents data that can change over time, 

we can also say 
The useState hook is used to initialize a state variable called data . This variable will store the data retrieved from an API endpoint

useEffect:
useEffect hook is used to request data from the API endpoint

The useEffect Hook allows us to perform side effects on the components. fetching data, directly updating the DOM and timers are some side effects. It is called every time any state if the dependency array is modified or updated.
